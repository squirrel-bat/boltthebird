Yes.

## About this Project
I wrote this microsite as yet another exercise in CSS3 + HTML + plain(!) JS.
It's meant to look and feel goodâ„¢, be reasonably performant without the use of any frameworks / packages / libs / etc. and get the message across.
Oftentimes getting things done *simple and fast* came before *well and organized*, which leads us to the next point...

## What it's not
None of the JS should be mistaken for an example of reliable or even acceptable code for both professional and learning purposes.
It does what it does in a sloppy, stitched-together way, violates multiple best practises and I *do* know better, but - again - that's not the focus of this project.
